# Brazil-Deforestation-DETER

This report shows data on recent deforestation in Brazil, with visuals including categorisation of the deforestation and it's location, a map of the affected areas, and a timeline. 

The data was extracted from the "Notices - Legal Amazon" data provided by INPE: http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/en/download-2/

Data from July 2019 onwards is shown in this report. The data is visualised over time, by category and location, in combination with a map. Slicers at the top-left can be used to focus on particular locations, classes of deforestation and time periods. The visuals themselves are also interactive, so selecting data in one visual will filter all the others.
